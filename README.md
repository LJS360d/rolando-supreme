Discord Bot implementation of a MarkovChain to learn how to type like a user of the guild.  
Currently hosted on: [Railway](https://railway.app)<br>
Created with: [Fonzi2 framework](https://github.com/LJS360d/fonzi2)

## Overview

Rolando Supreme is a Discord bot that uses a single Markov Chain to mimic the speech patterns of users within all the servers it is in. The bot guesses the next word in a sentence based on the patterns it has learned.
As the training data used comes directly from public discord servers the bot is very _Based_ and has a lot of NSFW.


## Credits

The concept is inspired by [`Fioriktos`](https://github.com/FiorixF1/fioriktos-bot), a Telegram bot using similar principles.<br>
The codebase is based upon the original [`Rolando`](https://github.com/LJS360d/rolando2)
